  <h2 class="mt-3">What is quidditch?</h2>

  <p>
    Quidditch is a fast-paced, mixed-gender, full contact sport that is rapidly
    growing in popularity across the world. Invented in the USA in 2005, the
    sport has since spread across the world and is now played in more than 40 countries. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Quidditch players compete to score goals by throwing a quaffle (deflated volleyball)
    through the opposing team’s hoops while avoiding being hit by bludgers (dodgeballs)
    thrown by the opposing team’s beaters. The game ends when the snitch, a tennis ball
    attached to an impartial official, is caught by one team’s seeker.

    two teams, who compete at high level in the
    UK national league:
  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Holyrood Hippogriff Firsts</b> have consistently come out as
        one of the top 8 teams in the UK over the last three seasons.
      </li>
      <li>
          <b>Holyrood Hippogriff Seconds</b> prioritise development of individual players
          over winning medals, but are still a competitive team and have qualified
          for the last two British Quidditch cups, the national championship.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Highlander Tournament</h2>

    <p>
      Every October, Holyrood Hippogriffs hosts Highlander,
      the longest running quidditch tournament in the UK. 12th-13th October 2019 was its 7th iteration, hosted in 
      Inverleith Park, with participating teams from Scotland, the rest of the UK, and Europe.
