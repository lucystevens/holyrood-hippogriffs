  <h4>What is quidditch?</h4>

  <p>
    Quidditch is a fast-paced, mixed-gender, full contact sport that is rapidly
    growing in popularity across the world. Invented in the USA in 2005, the
    sport has since spread across the world and is now played in more than 40 countries. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Quidditch players compete to score goals by throwing a quaffle (deflated volleyball)
    through the opposing team’s hoops while avoiding being hit by bludgers (dodgeballs)
    thrown by the opposing team’s beaters. The game ends when the snitch, a tennis ball
    attached to an impartial official, is caught by one team’s seeker.

    teams have been an integral part of the UK quidditch landscape since the sport was first introduced
    to the country in 2011 and continue to place highly at national tournaments and represent the UK internationally.
